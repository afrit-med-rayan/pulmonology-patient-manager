# Patient Management System - Dr. S. Sahboub

A comprehensive, professional patient management system for pulmonology practice with modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open** `index.html` in your browser via a local server
2. **Start using** the system immediately - authentication is bypassed for development!

## 🖥️ How to Run

### **Option 1: Local Web Server (Recommended)**

1. **Open Command Prompt/Terminal/PowerShell**
2. **Navigate** to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\asus\OneDrive\Documents\pulmonology-patient-manager"
   ```
3. **Start Python server:**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
4. **Open browser** and go to:
   - `http://localhost:8000/` (main application)
   - `http://localhost:8000/index.html` (direct access)

### **Option 2: Other Server Options**

- **Node.js:** `npx serve .`
- **PHP:** `php -S localhost:8000`
- **Live Server (VS Code):** Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"

### **⚠️ Important: Use a Local Server**

This application requires a local server to function properly due to:

- Modern JavaScript modules and components
- CORS security policies
- Local file system access for data storage

### **Option 3: Other Server Options**

- **Node.js:** `npx serve .`
